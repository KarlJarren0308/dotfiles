#   This Bash File contains a function that lets you
#   traverse to specific directories. This function
#   is created to compile all necessary commands to
#   a single command.
#
#   How to user this function?
#   â†’ Source this file inside .bash_profile.
#     To do that you have to type and save this
#     command inside .bash_profile:
#
#     source ~/traverse.bash
#
#     If you placed this file elsewhere, you have to
#     include the directory.
